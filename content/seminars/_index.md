### Winter Semester 25/26
[Lucas Piessevaux](https://lucas-piessevaux.github.io), [Qi Zhu](https://qizhumath.wixsite.com/math) and I are organizing a seminar on motivic homotopy theory, starting from scratch and covering the Hopkins—Morel—Hoyois theorem and non A1 invariant motivic homotopy theory.
