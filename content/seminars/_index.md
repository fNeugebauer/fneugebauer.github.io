### Winter Semester 25/26
[Lucas Piessevaux](https://lucas-piessevaux.github.io), [Qi Zhu](https://qizhumath.wixsite.com/math) and I are organizing a seminar on motivic homotopy theory, starting from scratch and covering the Hopkins—Morel—Hoyois theorem and non \\(A^1)\\ invariant motivic homotopy theory. 
Both the [syllabus](/motivic_syllabus_15_08_2025.pdf] and the [participation form](https://forms.gle/UukfAK6XULW9KMAu8) are available now.
