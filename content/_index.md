# About Me
I'm a second year master student at Uni Bonn. My interest lie in homotopy theory and algebraic topology. Currently, I am writing my Master Thesis supervised by Markus Hausmann. I will start my PHD studies in Bonn in October. 

# Reading Seminar on Motivic Homotopy Theory
[Lucas Piessevaux](https://lucas-piessevaux.github.io), [Qi Zhu](https://qizhumath.wixsite.com/math) and I are organizing a seminar on motivic homotopy theory, starting from scratch and covering the Hopkins—Morel—Hoyois theorem among others. Details forthcoming
