name = "Algorithmic Computation of Reidemeister Torsion"
desc = "We develop an algorithm that computes the Reidemeister Torsion of the geometric realization of a simplicial set X with respect to a provided representation of X’s fundamental group. The SageMath implementation of our algorithm enabled us to automatically compute the Reidemeister Torsions of the Poincar´e Homology 3-Sphere with respect to all irreducible representations of its fundamental group."
